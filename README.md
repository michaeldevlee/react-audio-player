## Simple React Audio Player
This my first project in React with a functional barebones audio player. It to provide practice with React and serve as a proof of concept.

## What Does The Program Do?
Play, fast-forward, rewind, skip forward, and skip backward between songs from a fixed number of songs. Based on the current song, the following information will update:
- song name
- artist
- album cover
- current timing
- duration of the song
- contribution/credit link   

## Technologies Used
React
Node.Js
Javascript
HTML
CSS
Github Pages

## Challenges
- Learning React was by far the most difficult challenge in all of this. Let alone, I had minimal experience with Javascript as I am more familiar with video game programming in GDscript (python-like language used for game development for the Godot Engine).
- Understanding states, props, and how they relate to optimizing my component renders
